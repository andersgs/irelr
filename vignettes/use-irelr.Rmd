# Introduction

`irelr` is a package that implements the a Monte Carlo approach for reconstructing
pedigrees from genetic data information. It assumes that unbiased population allele 
frequency data is available. In some cases, it is possible to obtain this information
from the avaialble genetic data --- however, this assumes that the sample consists
mainly of `unrelated` individuals. If your sample consists of many related 
individuals, then independently derived population allele frequency data is 
necessary for `irelr` to be useful. 

# The data

## Data format

The most straight forward way of getting under way in using `irelr` is by having
the data in a standard `genepop` format, with alleles encoded with 3 digits. 
The data format specifications can be found 
[here](http://genepop.curtin.edu.au/help_input.html). 

Ultimately, the input format is a `genind` object from the `R` package `adegenet`
 (by Thibaud Jombart et al. [link](http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/adegenet).
Information on how to convert several data formats into a `genind` object can 
be found [here](http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/adegenet/docs/.valid.genind).

**`irelr` assumes a single population.**

Below are the first 20 lines of the `nancycats` dataset available in the package
`adegenet`. Once the `adegenet` package is loaded, it is possible to find out 
more about the data set by typing `?nancycats` in `R`'s command prompt.

```{r, example_genepop_file, echo = FALSE, comment=""}
cat(readLines(system.file("files/nancycats.gen",package="adegenet"), 
              n = 20), 
    file = '', 
    sep = "\n")
```

## Loading the data

If the data is in a `genepop` format, it can be easily loaded by using the 
function `read.genepop()` from the `adegenet` package (*note that the file 
must have the `.gen` extention*):

```{r, load_data}
# set file path location. substitute this for the actual path of your file
# note the need for a .gen extention. otherwise, an error will be generated.
file_path <- system.file("files/nancycats.gen", package = "adegenet")
# having a look at the file path
file_path
# loading the data into a variable called data
data <- adegenet::read.genepop(file = file_path, quiet = T)
# having a look at data
# notice that data is an S4 class of type 'genind'
# it includes 237 individuals, genotyped at 9 loci
# there are 108 alleles across the genotyped loci
data

# number of indivduals
length(data@ind.names)

# number of loci
length(data@loc.names)

# number of alleles per locus
data@loc.nall

# total number of alleles
sum(data@loc.nall)

# total number of populations
# irel will ignore the population division and attempt to estimate the 
# pedigree of all individuals in the data file
length(data@pop.names)

# irelr also assumes that individuals have unique identifiers
# at the moment, the individuals are just named after their population
data@ind.names

# this can be fixed by changing the data in the data file so that each 
# individual has a unique identifier. 
# alternatively, a list of names can be manually created and assigned to the 
# ind.names slot of the 'genind' object:
data(nancycats)
ind_identifiers <- nancycats@ind.names
ind_identifiers
data@ind.names <- ind_identifiers
data@ind.names
```

# Estimating relatedness indices

## The `sim_rel()` function

Once the data is loaded, we can use `irelr`'s `estimate_rel()` function to 
estimate relatedness indices for all pairs of individuals in the data set.

```{r, estimate_rel}
# estimate relatedness indices
rel_estimates <- irelr::estimate_rel(data = data)
# create a data.table with the results
# this will make it easier down the line to parse out individual indices
rel_est_dt  <- data.table(rel_estimates)
rel_est_dt
```

The output of the `estimate_rel()` function is a data.frame, which we transform
in to a `data.table` (this requires the `data.table` package). The output includes
to columns --- `ind1` and `ind2` --- that indicate for which two individuals the 
indices in the row refer to.

Eight indices are currently calculated:

  1. Four forms of the Queller and Goodnight (1989) index:
    - QG89_xy: Assymetrical form in which individual 1 
      is the reference (denominator), and individual 2 is 
      the numerator.
    - QG89_yx: same as above, but now individual 2 is the
      reference.
    - QG89_avg: mean of the two above estimators.
    - QG89_rsxy: ratio of the sum of the numerators and the sum of the 
      denominators of the first two indices above.
  2. One form of the Lynch and Ritland (1999) estimator:
    - LR99_avg: The mean of the for each individual as the reference in turn.
  3. Two forms of the Wang (2002) estimator: 
    - W02_cor: The corrected estimator.
    - W02_unc: The uncorrected estimator.
  4. One form of the Heg and Konovalov (2008) estimator:
    - HK08: Unlike the others, is based on population heterozygosity and not
      allele frequencies.
      
In addition, two other relevant pieces of information are outputted:
  
  1. `prop_alleles_shared`: proportiono of alleles shared between the dyad. 
    Thus, for instance, if the dyad are typed at 7 loci, there are 14 potential
    alleles to be shared.
  2. `prop_loci`: proportion of loci that share alleles. For instance, if a dyad
    is typed at 7 loci, and it shares alleles at 5, then this variable is 5/7.

Finally, the function also reports the number of missing loci (`n_missing_loci`),
which are the number of loci that did not have an allele call for at least one 
of the pair. Thus, relatedness indices are only calculated based on loci that
are genotyped for both individuals in the dyad. The loci with missing genotype
calls for a particular dyad are listed in the `missing_loci` column. If multiple
loci are missing, they are separated by a "." (e.g., `loc1.loc2`, would mean that
loc1 and loc2 are missing). This will be used later to assign classification error rates 
based on the available data for a dyad.

## Plotting the results

### Distribution of individual indices

The distribution of particular index can be displayed as follows:

```{r, hist_lr99, fig.cap = "Distribution of Lynch and Ritland (1999) indices for the nancy cats dataset across all possible pairs from 237 genotyped individuals.", message = F, fig.height=7, fig.width=7}
ggplot(rel_est_dt, aes(x = LR99_avg)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  xlab("Lynch and Ritland (1999) index") +
  ylab("Count")
```

We can divide up the histgram by missing loci (below). Here, the top left panel 
shows the distribution of indices for pairs that had complete datasets. Otherwise,
the panel label indicates the missing loci. As we can see, we have one pair 
that is missing loci `fca8`, `fca23`, `fca37`, and `fca77` (bottom row, second
panel from the left).

```{r, hist_lr99_by_miss_loc, fig.cap = "Distribution of Lynch and Ritland (1999) indices for the nancy cats dataset across all possible pairs from 237 genotyped individuals by missing loci.", fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, message = F}
ggplot(rel_est_dt, aes(x = LR99_avg)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  xlab("Lynch and Ritland (1999) index") +
  ylab("Count") +
  facet_wrap(facets = ~ missing_loci, ncol = 4, scale = 'free')
```

### Joint distribution of indices

We can easily examine the joint distribution of two indices as well (below).
As we can see, two estimators can often disagree substantially in their 
estimates. Their are pairs of individuals with `LR99_avg` values that are 
over 0.5 (indicating high relatedness), for which their `W02_cor` value is 
very close to 0 (indicating low relatedness). While we have not carried out
any experiments to test this, this suggests there might be value in using 
information from multiple indices when reconstructing pedigrees.

```{r, join_dist_lr99_w02cor, fig.cap = "Joint distribution of Lynch and Ritland (1999) and Wang (2002) corrected indices for the nancy cats dataset across all possible pairs from 237 genotyped individuals. The red lines indicate density contour lines, and the bold navy blue indicates the equal relatedness line.", fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, message = F}
ggplot(rel_est_dt, aes(x = LR99_avg, y = W02_cor)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_density2d(colour = "red") +
  geom_abline(a = 0, b = 1, size = 2, colour = 'navyblue') +
  xlim(c(-1,1)) +
  ylim(c(-1,1)) +
  xlab("Lynch and Ritland (1999) index") +
  ylab("Wang (2002) corrected index")
```

# Simulating data to classify pairs

In `irelr` one can simulate any relatedness category by simply figuring out 
the `k` vector. The `k` vector is a vector of 3 numbers, that must sum to 1.0.
Each value gives the proportion of loci for which a pair of individuals share 
0, 1, and 2 ancestors. Thus, for a pair of unrelated individuals, there 0.0 
loci for which they share 2 ancestors, 0.0 for which they share 1 ancestor, and
1.0 loci for which they share 0 ancestors. Thus, the `k`-vector is specified 
as `c(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. 

The `k`-vectors for the most usual relatedness categoris are:

  1. Unrelated: `c(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)`
  2. Half-sibs: `c(0.5, 0.5, 0.0)`
  3. Full-sibs: `c(0.25, 0.50, 0.25)`
  4. Parent-offspring: `c(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)`
  
The expected relatedness value for each category can be estimated by the 
weighted average of number of ancestors by `k`-value, normalized by the 
total number of possible ancestors (2). Thus, for parent-offspring dyads:

$$
po = 0.5 \times (0 \times 0.0 + 1 \times 1.0 + 2 \times 0.0)
$$

## Differentiating between full-sibs and half-sibs

A common case where reconstructing the pedigree of pairs of individuals might 
come in handy, is to differentiate between half-sibs and full-sibs in samples
taken from different bird nests. This could be used to get an estimate of 
the number of nests with extra-pair chicks, and thus give an estimate of number 
of extra-pair matings in a season for a particular bird species. Here, we will 
just focus on how to classify the data from the `nancycats` dataset into half-sibs
and full-sibs, but if one new which pairs belonged to each nest, it would be 
possible to classify the whole dataset, and then examine pairs by nest 
grouping.

### The `sim_rel()` function

Below, we demonstrate the use of the `irelr` function `sim_rel()` to generate
10,000 half-sib dyads and 10,000 full-sib dyads, and calculate for each simulated dyad the relatedness
estimators defined above.

**Note**: Here, `irelr` uses estimates of allele frequency derived directly 
from the dataset. As we see above for the Lynch and Ritland (1999) index, 
the great majority of pairs have an index close to 0. Therefore, it is 
reasonable to assume that the majority of pairs are unrelated, and we can 
obtain an estimate of population allele frequencies that is reasonably 
unbiased by a large proportion of highly related pairs. Eventually, `irelr` will
allow for inputting user defined allele frequencies that are independently 
derived from the dataset. These are expected to generate more a robust
pedigree reconstruction.

```{r, sims}
# set number of dyads to simulate
nreps <- 10000

# create a half-sib k-vector
hs_kvector <- c(0.5, 0.5, 0.0)

# simulate half-sib dyads, and output relatedness values
half_sibs <- irelr::sim_rel(data = data, reps = nreps, k_vector = hs_kvector)
half_sibs_dt  <- data.table(half_sibs)
half_sibs_dt

# add a relatedness category column to be used later
half_sibs_dt[, rel_cat := rep('hs', nreps)]
half_sibs_dt[, sim_ix := 1:nreps]

# create a full-sib k-vector
fs_kvector <- c(0.25, 0.5, 0.25)

# simulate full-sib dyads, and output relatedness values
full_sibs <- irelr::sim_rel(data = data, reps = nreps, k_vector = fs_kvector)
full_sibs_dt  <- data.table(full_sibs)
full_sibs_dt

# add a relatedness category column to be used later
full_sibs_dt[, rel_cat := rep('fs', nreps)]
full_sibs_dt[, sim_ix := 1:nreps]

# create a single data.table with all the simulations
sims <- rbindlist(list(half_sibs_dt, full_sibs_dt))
sims
```

### Examining the simulated values for a single index

Below, we demonstrate how to examine the distribution of the Lynch and 
Ritland (1999) index for both simulated relatedness categories. Two options 
for visualisation are shown, a `density` plot and a `boxplot` option. As we 
can see, there is substantial overlap in the distribution of these two 
indices. This is expected to contribute to a high mis-classification rate.

```{r, sim_plot_hist, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, message = F}
ggplot(sims, aes(x = LR99_avg, fill = rel_cat)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab("Lynch and Ritland (1999) index") +
  ylab("Density") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Relatedness categories", 
                      labels = c("Full-Sibs", "Half-Sibs")) +
  theme(legend.justification=c(1,0), legend.position=c(1,0.75))
```

```{r, sim_plot_boxplot, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, message = F}
ggplot(sims, aes(y = LR99_avg, x = rel_cat)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylab("Lynch and Ritland (1999) index") +
  xlab("Relatedness Category")
```

### The joint distribution of indices of different relatedness categories

Below, we plot the joint distribution of index values for the `full-sibs` 
(`y` axis) and `half-sibs` (`x` axis). The bold navy blue line is the 
equal index value line. The red contour lines indicate the density distribution, 
and the grey points are the simulated values. The vertical and horizontal black 
lines indicate the expected relatedness index value for the `half-sib` and 
`full-sib` categories, respectively. The figure demonstrates that `full-sibs`
are expected to have a larger index value than `half-sibs`, which is what 
one woud expect. It also shows that there is a non-trivial proportion of 
`half-sibs` that have a larger value than `full-sib` pair.

```{r, transform_sims}
# transform output to a new data.table that only has Lynch and Ritland 1999 values
sims_lr99 <- dcast.data.table(data = sims, 
                              formula = sim_ix ~ rel_cat, 
                              value.var = 'LR99_avg')
sims_lr99
```

```{r, sim_plot_joingt, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, message = F}
ggplot(sims_lr99, aes(x = hs, y = fs)) +
  geom_point(colour = 'gray50') +
  ylab("Full-sibs") +
  xlab("Half-sibs") +
  xlim(c(-1,1)) + 
  ylim(c(-1,1)) +
  geom_abline(a = 0, b = 1, size = 2, colour = 'navyblue') +
  stat_density2d(colour = 'red', n = 40, size = 1.5) +
  geom_vline(x = 0.25) +
  geom_hline(y = 0.50)
```

We can calculate the probability that the index value for a `full-sib` dyad 
is smaller than the index of a `half-sib` dyad by estimating the proportion 
of simulations for which LR99_fs > LR99_hs:

```{r,prop_fs_larger_hs}
sims_lr99[,sum(fs > hs)]/nrow(sims_lr99)
```

So, we can see that there is a ~0.8 probability that the `full-sib` index is 
larger than the `half-sib` index. 

We can also easily calculate summary stats for each relatedness category, such 
as the mean, median, and 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles:

```{r, summ_stats}
# mean relatedness values per relatedness category
sims_lr99[,list(fs_mean = mean(fs), hs_mean = mean(hs))]

# distribution summary per relatedness category
sims_lr99[,list(quantile = c(0.025, 0.50, 0.975),
                fs_summ = quantile(fs, p = c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975)), 
                hs_summ = quantile(hs, p = c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975)))]
```

### The Blouin classifier

The Blouin classifier attempts to set a threshold index value to distinguish
among different relatedness categories. The classifier specifies that the 
threshold be point where the probability of an index value given one category is 
equal to the 1 - the probability of the index value given the other 
category. This will become clearer below.

The probability of observing a index value that is at most *x* given that the 
relatedness category is `full-sib` can be calculated as:

```{r, prop_fs}
# pick a random threshold
threshold_value = 0.40

# the probability that the Lynch and Ritland (1999) index is at most 0.40 
# given that the relatedness category is full-sibs for the nancycats 
# dataset is:

sims_lr99[,sum(fs <= threshold_value)] / nrow(sims_lr99)

# so, we count how many simulated values under full-sibs relationship 
# category were 0.4 or less, and divide by the total number of simulations
```

Now, we ask what is the probability of observing an index value as large as *x*
or larger given that the relatedness category is `half-sibs`:

```{r, prop_hs}

# the probability that the Lynch and Ritland (1999) index is as large as 0.40 
# or larger given that the relatedness category is half-sibs for the nancycats 
# dataset is:

sims_lr99[,sum(hs >= threshold_value)] / nrow(sims_lr99)

# so, we count how many simulated values under full-sibs relationship 
# category were 0.4 or less, and divide by the total number of simulations
```

As we can see P(x $\le$ 0.4 | cat = fs) > P (x $\ge$ 0.4 | cat = hs) (0.34 > 0.21).
This tells us that this threshold value (0.4) is likely to be too conservative
(i.e., we are mis-classifying too many `full-sib` pairs incorrectly as `half-sib`
pairs). Given that in our hypothetical example we are looking for strong 
evidence for `half-sibs` in order to determine a minimum level of extra-pair 
paternity such a threshold might not be desireable. 

The Blouin classifier specifies that the optimal threshold value is where 
P(X $\le$ x | cat = fs) = P (X $\ge$ x | cat = hs). We can easily build 
an optmizer function that will give us that value:

```{r, blouin_classifier}
blouin_classifier <- function(data, rel_cats) {
  total_sims = nrow(data)
  minimize_function <- function(threshold, data, rel_cats, n) {
    cat1 = rel_cats[1]
    cat2 = rel_cats[2]
    p1 = data[,sum(eval(as.symbol(cat1)) <= threshold)] / n
    p2 = data[,sum(eval(as.symbol(cat2)) >= threshold)] / n
    return((p1 - p2)^2)
  }
  blouin_threshold  <- optimise(f = minimize_function, 
           interval = c(0,1), 
           data = data, 
           rel_cats = rel_cats, 
           n = total_sims)
  return(blouin_threshold$minimum)
}
blouin_threshold <- blouin_classifier(sims_lr99,rel_cats = c('fs', 'hs'))
# checking the value
blouin_threshold

# ensuring that they are indeed (nearly) equal (to within a reasonable
# expected difference given the simulation)
sims_lr99[,sum(fs <= blouin_threshold)] / nrow(sims_lr99)
sims_lr99[,sum(hs >= blouin_threshold)] / nrow(sims_lr99)

all.equal(sims_lr99[,sum(fs <= blouin_threshold)] / nrow(sims_lr99),
  sims_lr99[,sum(hs >= blouin_threshold)] / nrow(sims_lr99))
```

We can then plot the simulated values with the estimated densities for 
the index in question, along with the threshold. 

```{r, sim_plot_hist_plus_threshold, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, message = F}
ggplot(sims, aes(x = LR99_avg, fill = rel_cat)) +
  stat_density(kernel = 'cosine', alpha = 0.5, position = 'dodge') +
  xlab("Lynch and Ritland (1999) index") +
  ylab("Density") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Relatedness categories", 
                      labels = c("Full-Sibs", "Half-Sibs")) +
  theme(legend.justification=c(1,0), legend.position=c(1,0.75)) +
  geom_vline(x = blouin_threshold, colour = 'red', size = 2)
```

### Calculate misclassification errors

Given a particular threshold, it is then possible to calculate the mis-classification
error:

```{r, miss_class_error}
calc_error_rate <- function(threshold, data, rel_cats) {
  cat1 <- rel_cats[1]
  cat2 <- rel_cats[2]
  total_sims <- nrow(data)
  p1 <- data[, sum(eval(as.symbol(cat1)) <= threshold)] / total_sims
  p2 <- data[, sum(eval(as.symbol(cat2)) >= threshold)] / total_sims
  res <- matrix(rep(0,4), ncol = 2)
  res[1,1] <- 1 - p1
  res[1,2] <- p1
  res[2,1] <- p2
  res[2,2] <- 1 - p2
  row.names(res) <- c(cat1, cat2)
  colnames(res) <- c(cat1, cat2)
  return(res)
}
calc_error_rate(blouin_threshold, data = sims_lr99, rel_cats = c('fs', 'hs'))
# because the Blouin classifier finds the point that minimizes the error, the 
# error rate is symmetric. In other words, it is the same for both relatedness
# categories. Thus, with the Blouin classifier, the proportion of full-sibs 
# that are expected to be correctly classified is ~0.73, and ~0.27 will be 
# incorrectly classified as half-sibs. 
# THIS OF COURSE ASSUMES THAT OUR DATASET IS ENTIRELY COMPRISED OF FULL-SIB AND
# HALF-SIB PAIRS.
# Furthermore, this is an approximate error estimate. The precision of the estimate
# can be increased by simulating a larger number of dyads. The accuracy, however,
# depends on the number of sampled loci, and how unbiased the estimate of the 
# population allele frequency really is.
```

We could decide, for instance, that the error rate is still too large in favour
of `full-sibs` being incorrectly classified as `half-sibs`. In this case, 
one can examine how the error rate changes with the threshold. In the figure
below, we plot the proportion of simulated `half-sib` dyads (in black) and 
the proportion of `full-sib` dyads (in red) correctly classified given a 
certain threshold level. The vertical navy blue line give the Blouin threshold.
We can see that the closer we get to a `0` threshold, the more likely that the 
number of correctly classified `full-sibs` grows to almost 100%. Meanwhile, the
proportion of correctly classified `half-sibs` goes to almost zero. At this level,
we would be the most confident that any pairs classified as `half-sibs` are 
likely to be truly `half-sibs`. In this case, we have set the bar for the 
evidence required to classify a pair as `half-sibs` as very high. 

**Again, it should be stressed that this assumes that the sample in the dataset
is solely comprised of full-sibs and potential half-sibs.**

```{r, error_change, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, message = F}
thresholds = seq(0,1,length.out = 200)
change_thresholds <- sims_lr99[,
                               list(thresholds, 
                                    half_sibs = sapply(thresholds, 
                                                       function(th) sum(hs <= th)) / nrow(sims_lr99), 
                                    full_sibs = sapply(thresholds, 
                                                       function(th) sum(fs >= th)) / nrow(sims_lr99))]
ggplot(change_thresholds, aes(thresholds, half_sibs)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_line(aes(thresholds, full_sibs), colour = 'red') +
  geom_vline(x = blouin_threshold, colour = 'navyblue') + 
  xlab("Thresholds") +
  ylab("Proportion correctly classified")
```

### Classifying individuals

Now that we have set on a threshold (e.g., the Blouin threshold). It is easy 
to classify the observed values into relatedness categories:

```{r, classify_estimates, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, message = F}
# use the cut function to classify pairs using the Lynch and Ritland (1999) index.
# the function will give label 'hs' to all pairs that have an LR99_avg index
# value that is -1 < index â¤ Blouin Threshold. And, it will label as 'fs' pairs
# with LR99_avg index value that are Blouin Threshold < index â¤ 1.
# it automatically adds the results to the estimate data.table, which can then
# facilitate comparisons across estimators

### Adding an unrelated category

For completeness, we can add information on for an `unrelated` category, 
assuming, perhaps more realistically, that our dataset has not only 
`full-sib` and `half-sib` pairs.

#### Simulate unrelated individuals

```{r, sim_unrelated}
# create a unrelated k-vector
un_kvector <- c(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)

# simulate unrelated dyads, and output relatedness values
unrelated <- irelr::sim_rel(data = data, reps = nreps, k_vector = un_kvector)
unrelated_dt  <- data.table(unrelated)
unrelated_dt

# add a relatedness category column to be used later
unrelated_dt[, rel_cat := rep('un', nreps)]
unrelated_dt[, sim_ix := 1:nreps]

# create a single data.table with all the simulations
sims <- rbindlist(list(half_sibs_dt, full_sibs_dt, unrelated_dt))
sims
```

#### Plotting the distribution of relatedness values

```{r, sim_plot_hist2, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, message = F}
ggplot(sims, aes(x = LR99_avg, fill = rel_cat)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab("Lynch and Ritland (1999) index") +
  ylab("Density") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Relatedness categories", 
                      labels = c("Full-Sibs", "Half-Sibs", "Unrelated")) +
  theme(legend.justification=c(1,0), legend.position=c(1,0.75))
```

```{r, sim_plot_boxplot2, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, message = F}
ggplot(sims, aes(y = LR99_avg, x = rel_cat)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylab("Lynch and Ritland (1999) index") +
  xlab("Relatedness Category")
```

#### Checking the joint distribution

```{r, transform_sims2}
# transform output to a new data.table that only has Lynch and Ritland 1999 values
sims_lr99 <- dcast.data.table(data = sims, 
                              formula = sim_ix ~ rel_cat, 
                              value.var = 'LR99_avg')
sims_lr99
```

```{r, sim_plot_joint2, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, message = F}
# here, three plots are created comparing each of the three possible 
# pairs of three relatedness categories taken in groups of two

# plot of full-sibs vs half-sibs simulations
p1 = ggplot(sims_lr99, aes(x = hs, y = fs)) +
  geom_point(colour = 'gray50') +
  ylab("Full-sibs") +
  xlab("Half-sibs") +
  xlim(c(-1,1)) + 
  ylim(c(-1,1)) +
  geom_abline(a = 0, b = 1, size = 2, colour = 'navyblue') +
  stat_density2d(colour = 'red', n = 40, size = 1.5) +
  geom_vline(x = 0.25) +
  geom_hline(y = 0.50)

# plot of full-sibs vs unrelated simulations
p2 = ggplot(sims_lr99, aes(x = un, y = fs)) +
  geom_point(colour = 'gray50') +
  ylab("Full-sibs") +
  xlab("Unrelated") +
  xlim(c(-1,1)) + 
  ylim(c(-1,1)) +
  geom_abline(a = 0, b = 1, size = 2, colour = 'navyblue') +
  stat_density2d(colour = 'red', n = 40, size = 1.5) +
  geom_vline(x = 0.0) +
  geom_hline(y = 0.50)

# plot of half-sibs vs unrelated simulations
p3 = ggplot(sims_lr99, aes(x = un, y = hs)) +
  geom_point(colour = 'gray50') +
  ylab("Half-sibs") +
  xlab("Unrelated") +
  xlim(c(-1,1)) + 
  ylim(c(-1,1)) +
  geom_abline(a = 0, b = 1, size = 2, colour = 'navyblue') +
  stat_density2d(colour = 'red', n = 40, size = 1.5) +
  geom_vline(x = 0.0) +
  geom_hline(y = 0.25)

#plotting the the three plots above in a single figure.
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 2)
```

The probability that `full-sib` pair has an index larger than an `unrelated`
pair is:

```{r,prop_fs_larger_un}
sims_lr99[,sum(fs > un)]/nrow(sims_lr99)
```

The probability that `half-sib` pair has an index larger than an `unrelated`
pair is:

```{r,prop_hs_larger_un}
sims_lr99[,sum(hs > un)]/nrow(sims_lr99)
```

#### Classify pairs using the Blouin classifier

Here, we apply the Blouin classifier function that we created above to 
identify the two thresholds needed to differentiate the three simulated
relatedness categories of interest:

  1. fs --- hs threshold
  2. hs --- unrelated threshold
  
The density plot of the simulated values is then used to visualize the Blouin
thresholds.

```{r, blouin_classifier2, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, message = F}
rel_cats <- c('fs','hs','un')
n_thresholds <- 2
blouin_thresholds <- numeric(n_thresholds)
for(i in 1:n_thresholds) {
  blouin_thresholds[i] <- blouin_classifier(sims_lr99,
                                            rel_cats = c(rel_cats[i], 
                                                         rel_cats[(i+1)]))
}

ggplot(sims, aes(x = LR99_avg, fill = rel_cat)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab("Lynch and Ritland (1999) index") +
  ylab("Density") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Relatedness categories", 
                      labels = c("Full-Sibs", "Half-Sibs", "Unrelated")) +
  theme(legend.justification=c(1,0), legend.position=c(1,0.75)) +
  geom_vline(x = blouin_thresholds, colour = 'red', size = 2)
```

Once the thresholds have been identified, we can use them to classify observed 
pairs, and estimate error probabilities. As we can see in the bar plot below,
adding the `unrelated` class dramatically changed the number of identified
`half-sibs`.

```{r, class_three_categories, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, message = F}
# we first start be creating a vector of thresholds to separate across 
# categories
# because the thresholds need to be from lowest to highest, we use the 
# sort() function to make sure they are in increasing order. 
# then, add the bottom (-1) and top (1) thresholds, as relatedness indices
# should not be less than -1 or greater than 1.
blouin_thresholds <- c(-1, sort(blouin_thresholds), 1)

# we then again use the cut function to classify pairs using 
# the Lynch and Ritland (1999) index --- this can be repeated with any 
# simulated index.
# the function will give label 'hs' to all pairs that have an LR99_avg index
# value that is -1 < index â¤ Blouin Threshold. And, it will label as 'fs' pairs
# with LR99_avg index value that are Blouin Threshold < index â¤ 1.
# it automatically adds the results to the estimate data.table, which can then
# facilitate comparisons across estimators
rel_est_dt[,lr99_class := cut(LR99_avg, 
                              breaks = blouin_thresholds, 
                              labels = c("un","hs", "fs"), 
                              include.lowest = T)]

# tally the number of pairs in each class
table(rel_est_dt[,lr99_class])

# plot the number of pairs in each class
ggplot(rel_est_dt,aes(lr99_class)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  xlab("Pairs classified using the Lynch and Ritland (1999) index using the Blouin threshold.") +
  ylab("Count")
```

Estimating the error becomes a little more complex when there are more than 
two classes. But, we can use the thresholds vector to our advantage here.

```{r,miss_class_error_general}
calc_error_rate_general <- function(thresholds, data, rel_cats) {
  n_cats <- length(rel_cats)
  total_sims <- nrow(data)
  res = matrix(rep(0,n_cats^2), ncol = n_cats)
  for (i in 1:n_cats) {
    class_sims <- data[, cut(eval(as.symbol(rel_cats[i])), 
               breaks = thresholds, 
               labels = rel_cats, 
               include.lowest = T)]
    res[i,] <- rev(table(class_sims)/total_sims)
  }
  rownames(res) <- rel_cats
  colnames(res) <- rel_cats
  return(res)
}

calc_error_rate_general(blouin_thresholds, 
                        data = sims_lr99, 
                        rel_cats = c('fs', 'hs', 'un'))
# the resuls are a table, where the rows indicate the relatedness category
# that was simulated, and the columns the relatedness category that the 
# simulated dyad was classified given the thresholds used. So, about 0.73
# of the full-sib dyads were correctly classified as full-sibs, while a 
# little over 0.25 were classified as half-sibs, and less than 0.02 were 
# classified as unrelated.
```

Again, we might not be satisfied with these rates. For instance, one might be
interested in identifying pairs of dyads that have high support for being 
`full-sibs`. To do this, we could say that there should be fewer than 10% 
false `full-sibs`, where as at the moment, close to 28% (0.2691 + 0.0105) of 
pairs identified as `full-sibs` are not `full-sibs`. To do this, we can 
modify our threshold calculator function to find the optimal threshold that 
minimizes the missclassification error (i.e., that minimizes the number of 
pairs simulated in other categories than `full-sibs`, but mistakenly classified
as `full-sibs`.

```{r, mod_threshold_function, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, message = F}
# a function to find the threshold that minimizes the error rate of 
# full-sibs. It takes as input the simulated data, the minimum error rate
# the relatedness category of interest, and a list of other categories.

  total_sims <- nrow(data)
  minimize_function <- function(threshold, 
                                data,

                                n) {
    n_cats <- length(other_cats)
    prop_missclass = 0

    }
    return((prop_missclass - error_rate)^2)
  }

  return(new_threshold$minimum)
}

# Comparing indices

Inferences about a pedigree sould be made using the index that 
minimizes miss-classification errors. The variance of the distribution of 
an index can be used to compare across indices. As shown below, we can see
that different indices have very different properties depending on the 
relatedness category. And, as we saw above, the same pair can have 
very different index values across indices. However, the variance is just one
aspect of the distribution of indices. The skewness and kurtosis can also 
give us valuable information.

Ultimately, the index of choice, will depend on what is wanted. If one wants
to identify `full-sibs`, then the index should be such that the bias and 
variance is smallest for the `full-sib` category, but that it is also 
relatively symmetrical about the expected relatedness value 
(i.e., has skewness close to 0), and is peaked around the expected 
relatedness value (i.e., most of the density is on or just around the 
expected value, thus, the kurtosis is highly positive).

```

From the above, we can see that perhaps `QG89_rsxy` is the best relatedness
index given our data. In the mean ranking, it is tied with `QG89_xy`, but 
the latter is not a symmetrical relatedness index, so we prefer the former.
However, none of the relatedness indices was a clear winner, with the top 
ranking indices having a mean rank close to 4.
Thus, in addition to `QG89_rsxy`, it is might be useful to also examine 
`W02_cor`, `LR99_avg`, and `hk08`. These give us a breadth of different 
indices to examine the error rates.

Below, we rank the relatedness indices bases on their bias, variance, 
skewness, and kurtosis. We then use the Blouin classifier to find 
optimal thresholds to separate `unrelated`, `half-sib`, and `full-sib` 
pairs.

Now that we have thresholds, we can estimate the error rates for each 
index. As we can see from the figure below, `hk08` is the most variable index,
while`QG89_rsxy` is the best index for identifying `full-sibs` and `half-sibs`.
Although, this comes at a slight disadvantage when identifying `unrelated` 
individuals.

```{r, error_rates_by_index, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, message = F}
# our error function
calc_error_rate_general <- function(thresholds, data, rel_cats) {
  n_cats <- length(rel_cats)
  total_sims <- nrow(data)
  res = matrix(rep(0,n_cats^2), ncol = n_cats)
  for (i in 1:n_cats) {
    class_sims <- data[, cut(eval(as.symbol(rel_cats[i])), 
               breaks = thresholds, 
               labels = rel_cats, 
               include.lowest = T)]
    res[i,] <- rev(table(class_sims)/total_sims)
  }
  rownames(res) <- rel_cats
  colnames(res) <- rel_cats
  return(res)
}
# adding the limits and re-ordering the thresholds
blouin_thresholds <- cbind(
  rep(-1,nrow(blouin_thresholds)), 
  blouin_thresholds[,2], 
  blouin_thresholds[,1], 
  rep(1,nrow(blouin_thresholds)))

error_rates <- lapply(indices, function(ix)
  calc_error_rate_general(threshold = blouin_thresholds[ix,],
                  data = sims_dt[index == ix,list(sim_ix,fs, hs, un)], 
                  rel_cats = c("fs", "hs", "un"))
  )
names(error_rates) <- indices
prop_class <- sapply(error_rates, diag)
prop_class <- melt(prop_class)

ggplot(prop_class, aes(x = Var1, y = value, fill = Var2)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge') +
  xlab("Relatedness category") +
  ylab("Proportion correctly classified") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Relatedness Index")
```

# Separating `parent-offspring` from `full-sibs`

Separating `parent-offspring` pairs from `full-sibs` is not generally possible
with relatedness indices only. At the moment, the best option is to examine
patterns of proportion of loci with at least one shared allele.
